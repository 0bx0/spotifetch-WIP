# 🎧 Spotifetch-WIP
A terminal-based Spotify profile viewer with neofetch-style ASCII art and colorful output. Built using Python and Spotipy.

# 📦 About

Spotifetch mimics the iconic style of neofetch, but for Spotify users. It shows your user stats, currently playing track, top and recent artists — all styled with colors and a cool ASCII logo.

> ⚠️ This is a Work in Progress — I'm still adding stuff and polishing it
